# PokeAPI-Project
This website was an opportunity to practice retrieving information from an API utilizing JavaScript and helped me improve my visual design skills. The site takes in user input regarding different Pokemon traits and returns Pokemon that have all of those traits.

# Tools
This site made with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

# Future Plans
The site is fully functional, my only plan is to fix the issue that requires the user to hit the search button twice in order to recieve the correct output.
